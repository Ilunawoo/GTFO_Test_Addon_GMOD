# GTFO_Test_Addon_GMOD

This is a garry's mod addon, aiming to recreate some features from GTFO.

It actually contain :
- a HUD, based on the gtfo's hud
- a small terminal ( not finished yet )

Future things :
- a normal terminal and more functionality for it 
- an infection system ( with fog )
- medipacks and ammopack
And maybe more ! Why not !

Put the folder of the addon in your garry's mod addon's folder (steam\steamapps\common\Garry's mod\garrysmod\addons) for playing with it ( you need to extract it if it is in .zip )
